These are the learning resources for YAGPDB's powerful custom command system. This is your playground!

We are going to teach you how to read code as well as how to write it. After all, how can you **write** if you cannot
**read**? Learn to read, learn to solve problems, and learn to enjoy the process. The community is there to help, as
long as you put in some effort yourself.

To understand the custom commands interface you will be interacting with on the control panel, please read the
documentation on [custom commands](/docs/custom-commands/commands).

## General Tips

As you start your journey with YAGPDB, there are a few things you should keep in mind. These tips will help you avoid
common pitfalls and make your developing experience as a whole more enjoyable.

You should start writing and testing custom commands on a separate testing server on Discord before adding them to your
main server. This way, you already avoid a lot of problems caused by members potentially interfering with an incomplete
custom command.

There is no "undo"-button, and kicking YAGPDB won't reset your configuration. Write your changes down first, then you
can revert them if something goes wrong.

Never assume YAGPDB is running 24/7/365. It is a free service, and not guaranteed to be up all the time. Do not
write your custom commands based on that assumption.

Start simple. Don't try to write a complex custom command right away. Start with something simple, then iteratively
improve upon that.

Be sure to read the [reference documentation](/docs/reference/templates) along the lessons here. We will not cover every
detail of every function in these lessons, rather give you the tools necessary to build complex systems.

Over time, your custom commands may get more lengthy and complex. It is a good idea to write them locally in some text
editor or IDE, and then paste them into the web interface.
